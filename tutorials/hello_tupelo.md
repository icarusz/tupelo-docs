# Hello Tupelo
{: .fs-9 }

Hello World makes a good first step to explore a new language or platform.

It is worth noting that through these simple steps the data is being
submitted (via a Chain Tree) and signed by a Notary group.  

To the developer it feels like storing it to any datastore such as a
document database.  After that submit however, the information is being reviewed,
confirmed valid and made immutable by the network. Tupelo makes DLTs easy.  

The validation can be done locally or on our test-net but the process is
the same in either case.  

We have provided two different versions of our Hello World:

[Hello World via Shell](hello_tupelo/shell){: .btn .btn-green .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }
[Hello World via Node](hello_tupelo/node){: .btn .btn-green .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }
