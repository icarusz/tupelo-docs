# Tupelo Tutorials

In support of helping developers get started we have created a series of tutorials.
We start with the most simple and get progressively more sophisticated.

***

## Hello Decentralized World

The obligatory first tutorial is the "Hello World" app.
For this project it is a little more appropriate than most, as we will be
creating a message and getting it signed by the Tupelo Network. We are actually
saying "Hello" to this new decentralized "World."

This should only take a few minutes and we will have a Chain-Tree that contains
immutable proof that we said Hello to the Tupelo World on this day.

## Notebook App

One of the use cases for blockchain is in recording information that is
immutable.  This walkthrough takes you through the building of a simple
Javascript app which allows the user to "stamp" notebook entries.
That means they will be signed by the Tupelo network and that what
was written and when can be proven at any time in the future.

## Internet of Things Sensor Log

One area that Tupelo excels at is interacting with IoT sensors.  
This is because Tupelo models "things" and can easily record the data generated
by those things.  The detectors in question can even even transferred from owner
to owner as the item being monitored moves through a supply chain.  

This is all accomplished **WITHOUT** a smart contract!  

Coming Soon!

## Multi-Part Scooter Application

This tutorial will cover multiple aspects of how Tupelo can be used to run an
entire Scooter renting app enabling the exploration of different ways
it can be used.  

Part One will cover inventory and location  
Part Two will cover user identity and payment  
Part Three will cover interacting with the scooter (including when offline)  
Part Four will cover limited views for regulators  
Part Five will cover central company operations
