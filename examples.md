# Example Projects

## Tupelo Explorer and Wallet

Tupelo Explorer is a WASM, react-based app built on the Tupelo WASM SDK.  
The explorer enables users to browse ChainTrees, the data-structure underlying
Tupelo.  Tupelo Explorer can also be used as a basic wallet.  

Combining the power of WASM with the speed of accessing a DLT (Tupelo) from the
browser opens up exciting new user facing applications.

## [Decentracar](/examples/decentracar)

Decentracar is a demonstration of how a decentralized ride sharing company could
work on a fast, accessible DLT like Tupelo.  

The ride-sharing company acts to screen and register both users and drivers but
eligible riders and drivers then use p2p pubsub to efficiently arrange rides
without an expensive centralized process.  Note the important distinction between
decentralization and full disintermediation which are discussed
as part of the exploration.

## IoT - Tupelo Based Lock Control via Zwave and Raspberry Pi

The winner of a Tupelo coding challenge this proof of concept project uses
ChainTrees, Zwave and Raspberry Pi to remotely control a house lock.  
The react-native client can be granted temporary access with control and tracking
all signed by the Tupelo testnet.
