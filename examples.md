# Example Projects

## Tupelo Explorer and Wallet

The WASM explorer is a react-based app using the Tupelo WASM SDK.  The explorer
enables users to browse ChainTrees the datastructure underlying Tupelo.

A demo running against the Tupelo Testnet can be found here:

## [Decentracar](/examples/decentracar)

Decentracar is a demonstration of how a decentralized ride sharing company could
work on a fast, accessible DLT like Tupelo.  The ride-sharing company acts to
screen and register both users and drivers but eligible riders and drivers then
use p2p pubsub to efficiently arrange rides without and expensive centralized
process.

## IoT - Tupelo Based Lock Control via Zwave and Raspberry Pi

The winner of a Tupelo coding challenge this proof of concept project uses
ChainTrees, Zwave and Raspberry Pi to remotely control a house lock.  
The react-native client can be granted temporary access with control and tracking
all signed by the Tupelo testnet.
