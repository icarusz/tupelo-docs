# Tupelo Overview

# What is Tupelo?

Tupelo is a new Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) project that is fundamentally different. Rather than a single blockchain, Tupelo maintains a separate history for every object. The history is kept in a new data structure called a Chain Tree. This foundational change is ideal for a variety of applications that concern assets (both physical and digital) and supports crypto currency applications.

## Understanding Tupelo
Most DLT systems are built around a detailed accounting of who has how many fungible (interchangeable) coins. Foundationally, Tupelo is built to model more complex, unique, real-world or digital things. Every object in Tupelo innately has one or more owners, a variety of attributes, and a unique history.

For example, consider a car, a house, a digital collectible, a personâ€™s identity, or a batch of coffee moving through a supply chain. Each of these objects has many unique instantiations with different features. Their attributes may change over time but they all represent a singular unique entity, have specified owners at any given time, and have a history that persists.
