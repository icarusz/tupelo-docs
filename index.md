# Hello Decentralized World

<img style="float: right; padding:6px;" src="assets/images/wasm_sample_code.png">

We want to show you how easy it is to build on Tupelo.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

You can read all about Tupelo below, or if you prefer to learn by doing, **jump in and try our
new [Tupelo WASM SDK](https://www.tupelo.org/blog/2019/8/22/new-wasm-based-sdk-for-tupelo)**.
The WASM SDK enables you to easily leverage all the power of a DLT right from a browser.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

Another option is to run through our [“Hello World” tutorials](tutorials) and have your
first transaction signed in minutes.  (Thats a total of minutes to set up and submit the
request, the Tupelo TestNet will sign your transaction in well less than a second!)

# We Are Distributed Ledger Done Differently

**Tupelo is purpose-built for the things you’re building.**
ChainTrees, our completely unique data structure, open the door for practical,
real-world application development.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

With ChainTrees, each object or actor is modeled independently allowing for
infinite sharding. This makes the underlying system much more efficient,
flexible, and transferrable than existing cumbersome, single chain systems.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

A ChainTree is made up of a chain for the history of the object and a tree to flexibly
store relevant data.  The data can be of any type and be made public, private or semi-private
depending on your applications needs.

# A Better Developer Experience

Traditional DLT platforms are often complicated to use because they aren’t built
for what you need. You’re spending too much time trying to warp your application
to a new structure and paradigm.  
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }
**Tupelo is easy.**
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }
Tupelo's simple API makes using a DLT more like using a database.
Combine the simple interface with our growing list of familiar language libraries, and our
fast, cheap, public signing network and you can have your project up-and-running
in no time.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }
Tupelo is built for building. Come see for yourself.
