# Hello Decentralized World

Tupelo is easy.

The straightforward API and growing list of familiar language libraries make integrating
the power of a distributed ledger into your application fast and simple.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

Please take a minute and **try our ["Hello World" tutorial](/tutorials/node)** in Node.  You will have your first transaction signed in no time.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

You can read all about Tupelo below, or if you prefer to learn by doing, **[jump in and build
a small app](/tutorials/notebook)** for recording immutable notes on the Tupelo DLT.

Looking for samples to build off for your own work?  Check out examples leveraging the WASM SDK to do **[ownership transfer](https://github.com/quorumcontrol/tupelo-wasm-sdk/tree/master/examples/ownership-transfer), [setting and getting data](https://github.com/quorumcontrol/tupelo-wasm-sdk/tree/master/examples/set-and-get-data) or [issuing and transferring tokens](https://github.com/quorumcontrol/tupelo-wasm-sdk/tree/master/examples/tokens)**.

# Tupelo Is Distributed Ledger Done Differently

**Tupelo is purpose-built for the things youâ€™re building.**
ChainTrees, our completely unique data structure, open the door for practical,
real-world application development.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

With ChainTrees, each object or actor is modeled independently allowing for
infinite sharding. This makes the underlying system much more efficient,
flexible, and transferrable than existing cumbersome, single chain systems.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

A ChainTree is made up of a 'chain' for the history of the object and a 'tree' to flexibly
store relevant data.  The data can be of any type and be made public, private or semi-private
depending on your applications needs.
{: .fs-3 .fw-300 }
Read on to learn how this unique datastructure enables a much faster and more efficient
signing network while maintaining the integrity of the underlying data.
