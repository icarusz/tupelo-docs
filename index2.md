# We Are Distributed Ledger Done Differently

Put simply, **Tupelo is purpose-built for the things you’re building.** ChainTrees, our unique datastructure, completely changes the foundation from traditional DLT platforms; opening the door for practical, real-world application development.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

With ChainTrees, each object or actor is modeled independently allowing for infinite sharding. This makes the underlying system much more efficient, flexible, and transferrable than the existing cumbersome central chain system.

Tupelo is built for building. Come see for yourself.

Traditional DLT platforms are often complicated to use because they aren’t built
for what you need. You’re spending too much time trying to compromise with
inherently inflexible code rather than developing to spec.
