# We Are Distributed Ledger Done Differently

Put simply, **Tupelo is purpose-built for the things you’re building.**
ChainTrees, our unique data structure, is a completely different foundation
from traditional DLT platforms; opening the door for practical, real-world
application development.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

With ChainTrees, each object or actor is modeled independently allowing for
infinite sharding. This makes the underlying system much more efficient,
flexible, and transferrable than the existing cumbersome, single chain systems.

Tupelo is built for building. Come see for yourself.

Traditional DLT platforms are often complicated to use because they aren’t built
for what you need. You’re spending too much time trying to compromise with
inherently inflexible code rather than building your application.
