Decentracar is a demonstration of how a decentralized ride sharing company could
work on a fast, accessible DLT like Tupelo.  The ride-sharing company acts to
screen and register both users and drivers but eligible riders and drivers then
use p2p pubsub to efficiently arrange rides without an expensive centralized
process.  

An explanation of Decentracar and its key components **[can be found here](https://www.tupelo.org/posts/decentracar ).**

A running demo of the application **[can be found here](https://quorumcontrol.github.io/decentracar/).**

and decentralization **[can be found here](https://www.tupelo.org/posts/dlt-isnt-disintermediation).**
