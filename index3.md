# Hello Decentralized World
{: .fs-8 }
<img style="float: right; width:415px;height:231px; padding: 10px;" src="assets/images/code_sample.png">
Tupelo is a new kind of Distributed Ledger.
It has a different structure and has been built **for developers** first.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
**Get started now** by adding our “Hello World” message and get it signed
immediately.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
If you prefer the good old command line give this a try.
If a few lines of code is more your style this might be better.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
If you want something a bit more challenging we have a tutorial for building
a simple notebook app that lets you get your entries signed and
stored in a Chain Tree (our unique data structure).

Traditional DLT platforms are often complicated to use because they aren’t built
for what you need. You’re spending too much time trying to compromise with
inherently inflexible code rather than building your application.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
**Tupelo is easy.**
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
Through our simple API, growing list of familiar language libraries, and our
fast, cheap, public signing network, you can have your project up-and-running
in minutes.  
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
Our comprehensive documentation and accessible engineering team will cover
everything you need to know to build on the platform.

# We Are Distributed Ledger Done Differently
{: .fs-8 }
<img style="float: right; width:375px;height:320px; padding: 15px;" src="assets/images/howistupelodifferent.png">

Put simply, **Tupelo is purpose-built for the things you’re building.**
ChainTrees, our unique data structure, is a completely different foundation
from traditional DLT platforms; opening the door for practical, real-world
application development.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

With ChainTrees, each object or actor is modeled independently allowing for
infinite sharding. This makes the underlying system much more efficient,
flexible, and transferrable than the existing cumbersome, single chain systems.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

Tupelo is built for building. Come see for yourself.
